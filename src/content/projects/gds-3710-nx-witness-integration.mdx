In video surveillance environments, it is common for **video intercom systems and VMS platforms to operate in isolation**.  

The **Grandstream GDS3710**, for instance, is typically handled through proprietary mobile applications or SIP-based softphones, while the VMS remains responsible only for video monitoring.

This separation creates an operational gap: **intercom calls are not part of the VMS workflow**, forcing operators to switch tools and fragmenting situational awareness.

From a systems perspective, this contradicts modern security architecture principles, which prioritize **convergence and centralized event handling**.

---

### The Problem

Without native integration between the GDS3710 and **Nx Witness / Hanwha Wisenet Wave**:

- Doorbell calls do not appear in the VMS timeline  
- Operators must rely on external applications to handle intercom events  
- Video context and intercom activity are split across systems  
- Incident response becomes slower and less consistent  

The lack of consolidation limits both operational efficiency and forensic traceability.

---

### My Approach

I designed and implemented a **Python-based HTTP integration service** to bridge this gap.

Instead of introducing additional client applications, my goal was to **centralize intercom handling directly inside the VMS**, allowing doorbell calls to be treated as native surveillance events.

The solution listens for **HTTP notifications from the GDS3710** and translates them into **manual events in Nx Witness / Wisenet Wave**, fully linked to the relevant camera.

This approach aligns intercom activity with existing VMS workflows, enabling operators to work from a single interface.

---

### How the Integration Works

1. The service runs a lightweight HTTP server listening for POST requests from the GDS3710.
2. Incoming notifications are parsed and validated.
3. Only doorbell call events are processed.
4. When required, the service authenticates against the Nx Witness REST API using JWT.
5. A manual event is created and associated with the configured camera.
6. The event becomes immediately visible in the VMS timeline.

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Event-driven design  
I used an event-driven approach based on HTTP notifications, avoiding polling mechanisms and ensuring low-latency processing.

#### Lightweight and stateless service  
The integration relies on Python’s built-in `http.server`, keeping the solution simple, auditable, and easy to deploy in LAN environments.

#### Secure API interaction  
Authentication with Nx Witness is handled via JWT tokens, with automatic renewal logic and sensitive configuration stored in environment variables.

#### Explicit video correlation  
Each event includes camera metadata, ensuring accurate timeline alignment and consistent playback behavior.

### Results

This integration:

- Centralized intercom events inside the VMS  
- Eliminated dependency on separate intercom applications  
- Enabled push notifications directly from the VMS  
- Provided immediate access to live video during doorbell calls  
- Improved response time and event traceability  

Most importantly, it demonstrated how **custom API integrations can consolidate traditionally siloed security systems** into a single operational platform.

### Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Built-in HTTP server (`http.server`)
- REST API integration (Nx Witness / Wisenet Wave)
- JWT-based authentication
- Environment-based configuration (`python-dotenv`)

### Takeaway

This project reflects my approach to systems integration:  
**identify fragmentation, understand platform capabilities, and design focused solutions that improve operational coherence without adding unnecessary complexity**.
